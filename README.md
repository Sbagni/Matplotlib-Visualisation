**Pymaceuticals** 

Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for
potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. Part of this project was
to complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over
the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. We analyzed the data to show 
how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare. We created some visualisations using matplotlib and pandas library
